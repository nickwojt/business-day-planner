# Business Day Planner

This project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript along with Bootstrap, JQuery, and Moment.js. 

To use the application just type events into the hour you would like and click the save button next to the targeted text field to save to local storage. The events will still be there upon refresh or closing of browser. Text areas are color-coded to show if they are in the past-grey, present-red, or future-green.
